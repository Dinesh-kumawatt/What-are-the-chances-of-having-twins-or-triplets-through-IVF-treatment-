# What-are-the-chances-of-having-twins-or-triplets-through-IVF-treatment-

IVF increases the chances of twins or triplets compared to natural conception because more than one embryo may be transferred to boost pregnancy success. While single embryo transfer is becoming more common for safety, older patients or those with repeated failed IVF attempts might benefit from transferring multiple embryos. However, multiple pregnancies carry higher risks like premature birth and complications for both mother and babies. Trinity IVF Ahmedabad provides individualized embryo transfer plans based on age, fertility history, and embryo quality to balance success with safety. Discuss your expectations with your fertility expert and choose an approach that aligns with your health and goals.
